# BERT-TweetAnalysis
**Keyword Extraction from Tweets** \
Tweet data is mined using the Twitter API and analysed to extract keywords using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT) \
Extracted keywords are added to the dictionary of words to use as reference for new words. Summarization is performed by relating keywords to topics based on similar context which is a vector space consisting of multiple clusters of related words.
